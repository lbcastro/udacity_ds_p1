Udacity Data Scientist Project 1



---



#### Goal

The goal with this project is to look into job satisfaction over time and evaluate the impact that income and lifestyle choices have on this metric. To do this analysis, several editions of Stack Overflow's yearly developer survey were used, ranging from 2011 to 2020.

#### Project structure

All the project's logic is contained and explained in main.ipynb, while the datasets are contained in the data/ folder. These datasets are compressed to comply with Github's filesize limits.

Data analysis was performed using Pandas, and visualization was handled by matplotlib. Python's libraries 'os' and 'zipfile' were also used to handle loading datasets.

#### Conclusion

Overall, it was found that even though salaries have been increasing almost every year, job satisfaction is declining. While this satisfaction metric is still relatively high, the trend is going in the wrong direction. This project compared job satisfaction with survey responses related to lifestyle choices and work habits, and found that people who take care of themselves usually report higher satisfaction at work.
